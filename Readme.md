# AI-Generated Image Detection Techniques

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of techniques for detecting AI-generated images. Each technique is organized into its own folder, containing all the necessary files and resources to run the detection process.

## Repository Structure

- **Technique Folders:** Each folder corresponds to a specific detection technique and includes everything required to implement and test that technique.
  - **`script.sh`:** A shell script that automates the setup process. It:
    - Creates the appropriate virtual environment(s).
    - Establishes the required directory structure.
    - Tests the technique on the images in the folder you provide.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the desired technique folder.**
2. **Run `script.sh`:** This script will handle the setup and testing process for you. Ensure that the images you want to test are placed in the correct directory as specified in the technique folder.
